# Holiday Hack Challenge 2020: Three French Hens

## Objective No. 1: Uncover Santa's Gift List
[Objective #1](screenshots/objective-1.jpg)

- I used the tool suggested in the hint. Took several attempts at twirling and untwirling before I could see what was on the list for him.
- Once I saw what was on the list, I read it as "poxmark", but had no idea if this was a thing, so I googled it. YUP! A very interesting thing at that. :)

## Objective No. 2: 

- Added wrapper3000 to the wordlist
- Found this bucket (wrapper3000) and the file "package"
- Now attempting to decompress the file
