There is a photo of Santa's Desk on that billboard with his personal gift list. What gift is Santa planning on getting Josh Wright for the holidays? Talk to Jingle Ringford at the bottom of the mountain for advice.

- First stop in the Holiday Hack challenge! I talked to Jingle Ringleford and downloaded the billboard image.
- I used the tool suggested in the hint. Took several attempts at twirling and untwirling before I could see what was on the list for him.
- Once I saw what was on the list, I read it as "poxmark", but had no idea if this was a thing, so I googled it. YUP! A very interesting thing at that. :)

## Objective No. 2: Investigate S3 Bucket
