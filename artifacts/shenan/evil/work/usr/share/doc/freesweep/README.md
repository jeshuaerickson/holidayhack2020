#freesweep

Freesweep is a console minesweeper-style game written in C for Unix-like
systems. The ncurses library is preferred, but standard System V curses will
work almost perfectly. Features include boards up to 1024x1024, saving and
loading of boards, shared and individual "best times" files, and color. 

Freesweep is maintained by Gus Hartmann <gus@gus-the-cat.org>, Peter Keller
<psilord@cs.wisc.edu>, and Randy Westlund <rwestlun@gmail.com>.

##License

Freesweep is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or above. See the file
COPYING, run freesweep with the -g flag, or hit 'g' while playing the game to
see it. The code is copyright Gus Hartmann and Peter Keller.

##Notes

- Bugs should be filed at https://github.com/rwestlund/freesweep/issues

- Color works, but right now the values are not customizable. Sorry.

- If no file locking mechanism is found, group-writable best times will be
  disabled.

- While the game is playable on any terminal supported by curses/ncurses, the
  help and high scores windows are designed to use a screen 80 columns wide.

Special thanks to Pete Keller for lots of help.
